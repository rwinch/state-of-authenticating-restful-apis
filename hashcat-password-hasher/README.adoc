A Java application that generates passwords in format `sha256($salt.$pass):$salt` (i.e. mode 1420) for https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes[hashcat].

* Passwords are read from src/main/resources/passwords.txt
* The output is written to passwords-A0.M1420.hash

You can crack the passwords using a dictionary attack by http://hashcat.net/files/hashcat-2.00.7z[Downloading Hashcat].

Ensure it is executable:

[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x hashcat*
----

Download and extract http://home.btconnect.com/md5decrypter/hashkiller-dict.rar[hashkiller-dict.txt] from https://hashkiller.co.uk/downloads.aspx into this folder.

Then run the following command (Linux):

[source,bash]
----
$ ./hashcat-cli64.bin -a 0 -m 1420 passwords-A0.M1420.hash hashkiller-dict.txt
----

A few notes:

* You may need to change the file extension for your OS.
* Alternatively, you can also use http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/[oclhashcat] if your OS/GPU is supported.
